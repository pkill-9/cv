\section{Previous Employment}
\begin{description}
    \item[2014 -- present] Casual tutor at the University of Melbourne. I
        have taught two introductory C programming subjects, which requires
        me to assist students who are confused or stuck on a programming
        problem, as well as managing the class in general.
    \item[2013 -- 2014] I worked for Ourcast during the summer break from
        university as a server side software engineering intern. My role
        included developing prototype machine learning algorithms to filter
        out false positives from rain radar images, prototyped in GNU 
        Octave. I also contributed to creating a program in Java to produce
        rain predictions on a radar station by station basis, and also code
        to measure the accuracy of the predictions. I found that my
        experience with Linux was very useful in this job, particularly when
        it came to using SSH and terminal commands, which I am well accustomed
        to.
    \item[2006 -- present] I am employed as the audio technician for Box
        Hill Ballet Association's end of year concert. Initially, this 
        involved a significant learning curve, as I had little experience 
        in operating an audio desk when I first started. This also involves 
        working as part of a team with the rest of the backstage crew, and
        following instructions from the stage manager.
    \item[2004 -- 2008] I Delivered daily newspapers for Vermont South
        Newsagency. This required attendance at 6:00 am, and attention to
        detail.
    \item[2011 -- 2014] I also delivered pamphlets on a casual/contract
        basis for Salmat.

\subsection{VCE Subjects}
In 2008, when I was in year 11, I completed IT Applications, and achieved a 
study score of 39. In year 12, I completed Chemistry, Maths Methods,
Specialist Maths, Physics and English Language for my VCE, and achieved 
study scores of 38, 37, 33, 34 and 26 respectively.


\section{Summary of Skills}
\begin{description}
    \item[\LaTeX{}] I am experienced with using the \LaTeX{} typesetting
        system, with which this document was prepared. I have also used
        it to typeset a procedures manual for The Hub Caf\'e, where I
        help out on a voluntary basis.
    \item[Linux/UNIX] I have had Ubuntu Linux installed on my PC since
        2008. As part of my course at university, I have also learnt to
        use Unix (Solaris in this case), where we were taught to use an
        SSH client, bash commands, and using the Vim editor. As a result,
        I have extensive knowledge of Linux and Unix.
    \item[Programming languages] I have had extensive experience writing
        programs in C, with projects including a multithreaded POP3 email 
        server, and a FAT32 file system driver. I also have extensive
        experience with object oriented programming in Java, and a limited
        knowledge of C++, C\# and Python. I have also learnt
        bash shell script, using it mainly for running tests on programs
        written for university assessment tasks.
    \item[Version control systems] I was taught to use Subversion as part
        of my university course, and have also learned to use Mercurial,
        which I use to track most of my personal projects. I have extensive
        experience with both of these tools, including setting up
        repositories, and checking in and out, both locally, and over a
        network.
    \item[Espresso Coffee] I have learnt to operate an espresso machine as
        part of my voluntary work at The Hub Caf\'e, and have consistently
        received positive feedback from customers about the coffee I make.
    \item[Bicycle Maintenance] Including reasonably advanced tasks: I have
        taught myself how to build bicycle wheels.
\end{description}


\section{Voluntary Work}
Boronia Church of Christ runs a caf\'e called ``The Hub'', where I have
recently been helping out. As part of my work there I have learnt to
operate an espresso machine, and have developed expertise at that task. I 
also operate the data projector and audio desk on a roster for Sunday 
morning church services (typically once or twice a month).

I have also volunteered for the Melbourne Bicycle Touring Club (MBTC), of
which I am a member. The club organises an anual event called the MAD ride
(Melbourne Autumn Day ride) to raise funds, which I have helped out at. I
also served on the club committee as Library and Equipment officer in the
2010 -- 2011 financial year, and am currently serving as the publicity
officer. I am also responsible for the club website and email addresses.

While I was at primary school and high school I also helped out at
numerous school working bees, mainly doing gardening work.

At the start of 2012 I also began to help out in a leadership role at the
youth group run by Boronia Church of Christ.


\section{Hobbies and Interests}
My hobbies include outdoor activities such as cross country skiing, cycling
and camping. I have already mentioned my involvement with the MBTC, and I
have been on numerous day rides and camping trips with the club. I have
also organised and led rides.

I have published a number of software projects that I have written in my
spare time on my github and bitbucket profiles, which can be found at
\url{https://github.com/pkill-9} and \url{https://bitbucket.org/void-star}
respectively. Among other things, I am interested in operating systems,
especially microkernels such as \textsc{minix}. I have also read the book
``Clean code'' by Robert C. Martin, and take an interest in producing clean
code myself.


I also enjoy reading and going to the movies, and have learnt calligraphy.

% TODO: adjust academic interests to include research project topic. Also
% bring back electronics/arduino, including bike speedo project.
