\subsection{VCE Subjects}
In 2008, when I was in year 11, I completed IT Applications, and achieved a 
study score of 39. In year 12, I completed Chemistry, Maths Methods,
Specialist Maths, Physics and English Language for my VCE, and achieved 
study scores of 38, 37, 33, 34 and 26 respectively.


\section{Previous Employment}
\begin{description}
    \item[2013 -- 2014] I worked for Ourcast during the summer break from
        university as a server side software engineering intern. My role
        included developing prototype machine learning algorithms to filter
        out false positives from rain radar images, prototyped in GNU 
        Octave. I also contributed to creating a program in Java to produce
        rain predictions on a radar station by station basis, and also code
        to measure the accuracy of the predictions. I found that my
        experience with Linux was very useful in this job, particularly when
        it came to using SSH and terminal commands, which I am well accustomed
        to.
    \item[2006 -- present] I am employed as the audio technician for Box
        Hill Ballet Association's end of year concert. Initially, this 
        involved a significant learning curve, as I had little experience 
        in operating an audio desk when I first started. This also involves 
        working as part of a team with the rest of the backstage crew, and
        following instructions from the stage manager.
    \item[2004 -- 2008] I Delivered daily newspapers for Vermont South
        Newsagency. This required attendance at 6:00 am, and attention to
        detail.
    \item[2011 -- present] I also deliver pamphlets on a casual/contract
        basis for Salmat.
\end{description}

\section{Summary of Skills}
\begin{description}
    \item[\LaTeX{}] I am experienced with using the \LaTeX{} typesetting
        system, with which this document was prepared. I have also used
        it to typeset a procedures manual for The Hub Caf\'e, where I
        help out on a voluntary basis.
    \item[Linux/UNIX] I have had Ubuntu Linux installed on my PC since
        2008. As part of my course at university, I have also learnt to
        use Unix (Solaris in this case), where we were taught to use an
        SSH client, bash commands, and using the Vim editor. As a result,
        I have extensive knowledge of Linux and Unix.
    \item[Programming languages] I have had extensive experience writing
        programs in C, with projects including a multithreaded POP3 email 
        server, and a FAT32 file system driver. I have also done some
        object oriented programming in Java, C\# and C++, and have found that
        I can pick up new languages reasonably easily. I have also learnt
        bash shell script, using it mainly for running tests on programs
        written for university assessment tasks.
        % TODO: this section needs to be updated to reflect knowledge of
        % object oriented programming (more than just "some").
    \item[Version control systems] I was taught to use Subversion as part
        of my university course, and have also learned to use Mercurial,
        which I use to track most of my personal projects. I have extensive
        experience with both of these tools, including setting up
        repositories, and checking in and out, both locally, and over a
        network.
    \item[Espresso Coffee] I have learnt to operate an espresso machine as
        part of my voluntary work at The Hub Caf\'e, and have consistently
        received positive feedback from customers about the coffee I make.
        % TODO: add bicycle maintenance, building wheels.
\end{description}

\section{Voluntary Work}
Boronia Church of Christ runs a caf\'e called ``The Hub'', where I have
recently been helping out. As part of my work there I have learnt to
operate an espresso machine, and have developed expertise at that task. I 
also operate the data projector and audio desk on a roster for Sunday 
morning church services (typically once or twice a month).

I have also volunteered for the Melbourne Bicycle Touring Club (MBTC), of
which I am a member. The club organises an anual event called the MAD ride
(Melbourne Autumn Day ride) to raise funds, which I have helped out at. I
also served on the club committee as Library and Equipment officer in the
2010 -- 2011 financial year.

While I was at primary school and high school I also helped out at
numerous school working bees, mainly doing gardening work.

At the start of 2012 I also began to help out in a leadership role at the
youth group run by Boronia Church of Christ.


\section{Hobbies and Interests}
My hobbies include outdoor activities such as cross country skiing, cycling
and camping. I have already mentioned my involvement with the MBTC, and I
have been on numerous day rides and camping trips with the club. I have
also organised and led rides.

My academic interests include distributed systems and file systems. I am
currently working on a FAT32 driver for Linux with the objective of
eliminating file fragmentation by using a smarter allocation algorithm.
For more information on that project, please refer to the project home
page on Google Code\footnote{
\href{http://code.google.com/p/emphatic-fs}{http://code.google.com/p/emphatic-fs}
}.

I am also interested in operating systems, especially microkernels, and I
have been working on a boot loader for such systems. My aim is for the
boot loader to be able to load multiple binary programs into memory, the
kernel as well as other system programs needed in order for the OS to
boot (eg. device drivers), and pass on information about what files
have been loaded to the kernel. The files to be loaded would be specified 
in a text based configuration file. This offers one solution to the problem 
of microkernels needing to incorporate device drivers into the kernel mode 
layer in order to load other OS components at boot time. Under this model, 
the task of loading other OS components is outsourced to the boot loader.

I also enjoy reading and going to the movies, and have learnt calligraphy.

% TODO: adjust academic interests to include research project topic. Also
% bring back electronics/arduino, including bike speedo project.
